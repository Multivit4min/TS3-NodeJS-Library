# TS3-NodeJS-Library

The TS3 NodeJS Library has been strongly influenced by [PlanetTeamSpeaks TS3 PHP
Framework](https://docs.planetteamspeak.com/ts3/php/framework/index.html)


# Introduction

This library can connect to a TeamSpeak Server Query interface, send and receive commands aswell as upload and download files via Filetransfer!

With vscode you will receive powerful autocomplete of functions and their return values, so vscode is highly recommended!

## Install

`npm install --save ts3-nodejs-scentral`
